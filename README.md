👋 Hello, I'm @Igorantivirus, you can just call me Igor.
👀 I'm interested in programming. I love coding in C++. I can work with C#. I have some knowledge of Python. + I know a bit about HTML/CSS. Though, I don't have extensive knowledge.
🌱 Currently, I'm studying in school, preparing for exams. I'm learning various libraries for C++ (SFML, opencv, ffmpeg, TgBot, Curl), studying them by creating my own specific projects, which are available on my GIT.
💞️ I'm not looking for collaboration in the next six months.

😄 Pronouns: He
⚡ Fun fact: watched a 10-hour course on C#, and three days later went to a hackathon to code in C#.
