Hello everyone, I am a C++ developer. I am working and actively studying Qt (also for Android in QML), Wasm, and just various libraries for standard C++
Little experience in C#, python.
1st year student in software engineering.
I am ready to cooperate. 
For communication, it is better to write on TG - @igorantivirus
